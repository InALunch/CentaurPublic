An experimental setup to do hybrid human forecasting + modeling for covid-19 forecasts

Our endpoint is total JHU confirmed deaths in the US, as detailed here: https://covid19forecasthub.org/

We are outputting forecasts early on. We expect the early forecasts to be crap, but doing them to still provide valuable information for our own processes. 

1-3 weeks from now, we'll re-evaulate and likely decide to do one of the following:

1) We are pessimistic enough about the project/don't like doing this project enough (eg because of lack of trust in the process, issues with team dynamics, or because we have better things to do with our time), and will scrape it.(internal validity)
2) We think that not only are our initial forecasts crap, but we do not see any trajectory for them to be better than existing forecasts on the Covid-19 Forecasting Hub, so our added value is zero or negative (external validity)
3) We think on balance we have a good process that can be improved with additional learnings and manpower, and are optimistic we can add value to the existing forecasts. In such a world, we'll add on additional volunteers and go through the process of submitting to Covid 19 Forecast Hub. (continue and scale)
4) We decide that the project looks reasonable and as a team finds more important things to forecast on. (pivot)

As with most startup/volunteer projects, the base rate is that we will fail. Hopefully by publishing our initial artifacts and thoughts before we know the final outcome, we can help fight against reporting/survivorship/publication bias.
